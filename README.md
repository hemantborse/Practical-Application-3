Practical Application 3 : Bank Marketing - Professional Certificate in Machine Learning &amp; Artificial Intelligence

Overview: In this practical application,  goal is to compare the performance of the classifiers - K Nearest Neighbor, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines. We will utilize a dataset related to marketing bank products over the telephone.

Getting Started
Our dataset comes from the UCI Machine Learning repository link. The data is from a Portugese banking institution and is a collection of the results of multiple marketing campaigns. We will make use of the article accompanying the dataset here for more information on the data and features.

The bank dataset is result of data collected by a Portuguese bank using telephone as dominant marketing channel and sometime internet online banking channel.
The dataset collected is related to 17 marketing campaigns that occurred between May 2008 and November 2010, corresponding to a total of 79354 contacts.

CRISP-DM Process Model is used

**Model Score Outcome **: Baseline and logistic regression models were created after training and testing : Logistic Regression seems a little higher in score this means baseline model did a little better , however both seem super close to each other in terms of performance
